# Data-S

### What is Computer Science?
Its a collecton of tools and techniques for solving problems.

### What is Engeneering?
A collection of tools and techniques to solve a problems.

### What is Programming?
A program is a concrete of instructions with syntax that a computer can carry out. It is an art and the science of writing good programs.
In the name of programming, the core idea of translating between reality and digital data is the very heart of what we do.

### What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a series of Instructions.
E.g., You can take one algorithm and can be applied in many programming languages.

Programs are sometimes also called: 
- Software
- Applications
- Code
- Scripts


Programs that you use every day:
- Vlc Media
- Web Browser
- Music Player
- Video Games

The concept of computer science and programming is to solve business problems.

### What is Programming Language?
Programs are nothing but instructions that are written in a particular programming language. Programming Language have a small vocabulary and a limited grammar.

### Two famous software:
- Generic Software (Systemic Software)
- Application Software

System software interacts with the hardware that is an operating system, which is nothing but a system of software to help you control the machine.

Application software uses some business logic to create some programs that help us to achieve a business goal.

### What is Syntax?
A Language for instructions.

2 rules:
- Syntax
Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation.

- Semantics
Logic, making sense, and intent.
Although the sentence here follows grammar rules, it doesn't make any sense. This is the idea of semantics - the rules concerned with the meaning.

### What is a compiler?
The compiler checks whether the written text syntax with semantics is correct or not. If it's incorrect it will give an error.

# Terminology:
RUN - Perform each step of a program line by line.
Execute - Run all at once.
Kill - To stop a program.

### Programming Environments
It is a software tools that help you make programs.
### IDE - Integrated development environment
It has 3 parts:
- **Editor**
Where you write your code.
- **Interpreter**
It is what runs your code
- **Console**
Where we see what our code does.

### What is Python?
- Its a free source.
- Its easy to learn.
- It is an Open Source Language.
- It has many Libraries.
- Python is known for its simplicity.
- It is portable. The code is transferable from one computer to another.
- It is an embeddable and extensible language.
- Python can be easily interpreted.
- Huge set of libraries are used for data manipulation, data adjustment, data analysis, and data visualisation.


### What is a Library?
- Collection of codes
- Collection of Programs
- It makes our life easier efficient and effective.

# Programming Languages
## Python -
- **Python is a preferred choice for around 60 to 70 % of data scientists and machine learning developers, particularly in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science**
- Python is not limited to AI and Machine Learning but is also used in various other development areas, scripting, and more.
- Python is considered a natural tool for development due to its versatility.

**Python's leadership in the market can be attributed to two main factors:**
- A focus on code and algorithms rather than complex syntax
- It's easy to learn syntax which resembles simple English.
- The Open source community actively contributes to python development, creating solutions to various problems.
- Python is an Interpreted Language, which reduces the edit-test-debug cycle because no compilation step is required.

## R - Academicians Paradox or Statisticians Paradox

- Python is favored by Computer Science Professionals, Programmers, and engineers due to its ease of use for coding.
- R is typically adopted by statisticians and academicians who require more graphical capabilities for statistical computing analysis and visualizations in machine learning.
- R is especially suitable for exploring statistical data through graphs.
- R is also widely used by Data Scientists at Google and Facebook.
- It's popular for statistical tasks such as regression, classification and decision reformulations in Machine Learning.

## Java
- It is also utilized for AI and dataset applications.
- Around 15 % of experts use Java for Network security, cyber-attacks, and fraud detection, especially in cases where Python may not be suitable.
- Java offers several advantages, including a simple debugging process, a wealth of available libraries, simplified works on large projects, graphical data representation, improved user interactions, and security features making it a preferred choice for cybersecurity applications.

## JavaScript
- Java Script is a widely used language primarily associated with web development.
- It is often chosen by data science and machine learning beginners, especially for enterprise-focused applications.

## Scala
- It's a core platform developed by Apache Spark, known for comprehensive big data processing and machine learning statistical algorithms.
- Scala has an extensive library for machine learning, making it useful for developing, designing, and deploying Machine Learning Algorithms.


# Modes
**Interactive Mode**
In this mode, Each command you type is interpreted and executed immediately, and you see the results each time you press enter. The interactive mode is the default mode if you don't pass a file name to the interpreter.

**Script Mode** 
In script mode, you put a set of Python statements into a text file with a .py extension. You then run the Python interpreter and point it at the file. The program is executed line by line and the output is displayed. There is no compilation step.

**Python Implementations**
Python is licensed under the Open-Source License. And there are several implementations available depending on your needs.

# **Some important IDE:**
- C Python
- Anaconda
- Iron Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Azure Cloud Shell
- Google Colab


**C Python** - The most popular available in the Python Website. C Python is commonly used for web-development, Application Development and Scripting. Linux users can install Python.

**Anaconda** - It is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages, primarily used for scientific computing in Data Science, Machine Learning, Large Scale Data Processing and predictive analytics.
