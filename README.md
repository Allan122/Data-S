# Data-S

### What is Computer Science?
Its a collecton of tools and techniques for solving problems.

### What is Engeneering?
A collection of tools and techniques to solve a problems.

### What is Programming?
A program is a concrete of instructions with syntax that a computer can carry out. It is an art and the science of writing good programs.
In the name of programming, the core idea of translating between reality and digital data is the very heart of what we do.

### What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a series of Instructions.
E.g., You can take one algorithm and can be applied in many programming languages.

Programs are sometimes also called: 
- Software
- Applications
- Code
- Scripts


Programs that you use every day:
- Vlc Media
- Web Browser
- Music Player
- Video Games

The concept of computer science and programming is to solve business problems.

### What is Programming Language?
Programs are nothing but instructions that are written in a particular programming language. Programming Language have a small vocabulary and a limited grammar.

### Two famous software:
- Generic Software (Systemic Software)
- Application Software

System software interacts with the hardware that is an operating system, which is nothing but a system of software to help you control the machine.

Application software uses some business logic to create some programs that help us to achieve a business goal.

### What is Syntax?
A Language for instructions.

2 rules:
- Syntax
Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation.

- Semantics
Logic, making sense, and intent.
Although the sentence here follows grammar rules, it doesn't make any sense. This is the idea of semantics - the rules concerned with the meaning.

### What is a compiler?
The compiler checks whether the written text syntax with semantics is correct or not. If it's incorrect it will give an error.

# Terminology:
RUN - Perform each step of a program line by line.
Execute - Run all at once.
Kill - To stop a program.

### Programming Environments
It is a software tools that help you make programs.
### IDE - Integrated development environment
It has 3 parts:
- **Editor**
Where you write your code.
- **Interpreter**
It is what runs your code
- **Console**
Where we see what our code does.

### What is Python?
- Its a free source.
- Its easy to learn.
- It is an Open Source Language.
- It has many Libraries.
- Python is known for its simplicity.
- It is portable. The code is transferable from one computer to another.
- It is an embeddable and extensible language.
- Python can be easily interpreted.
- Huge set of libraries are used for data manipulation, data adjustment, data analysis, and data visualisation.


### What is a Library?
- Collection of codes
- Collection of Programs
- It makes our life easier efficient and effective.
